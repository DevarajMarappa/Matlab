# Matlab
Objective: Your task will be to develop MATLAB code that will i) read the information in the file into
arrays / vectors / matrices, ii) use this information to estimate the density (of water) when the
temperature and pressure is specified, and iii) demonstrate the use of your MATLAB property lookup
procedure by programmatically preparing a graph of estimated liquid water density values for a suitable
range of temperatures (your choice) and a pressure of 101.325 kPa.
